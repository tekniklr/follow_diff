Designed to be run periodically via cron, will output new interesting 
twitter followers.

Interesting is currently defined as:
  * someone who has more people following them than people they follow
  * someone who is following them also follows us
  
This script is abandoned in a mostly complete state. I ran into a speed 
bump involving Net::Twitter not paginating results as advertised and lost 
interest in working around their bug.
